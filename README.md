SCENARIO ----->>>

THE TERM ANIMAL BEHAVIOR IS COMMONLY USED TO DESCRIBE WHAT AN ANIMAL DOES DURING ITS DAILY LIFE. ANIMAL BEHAVIOR, WHEN CONSIDERED OVER APPROPRIATE PERIODS OF TIME, IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF HEALTH, WELFARE, AND PRODUCTIVITY, PARTICULARLY FOR LIVESTOCK. IT CAN ALSO PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANIMALS’ ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, AND HERD DYNAMICS. CLASSIFYING ANIMAL BEHAVIOR ON WEARABLE DEVICES, SUCH AS ACCELEROMETERS ARE COMPACT AND LOW-POWER MOTION SENSORS THAT CAN MEASURE ACCELERATION ON THREE ORTHOGONAL SPATIAL AXES.

ANIMALS’ BEHAVIOR HAVING DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES LIKE LYING, EATING, RUMINATING ETC. FROM THESE, RUMINATION TIME THAT COULD BE USED TO MONITOR THE HEALTH AND REPRODUCTION OF DAIRY CATTLE. IN CONCLUSION, RUMINATION TIME COULD BE USED AS AN INDICATOR OF THE HEALTH STATUS IN DAIRY CATTLE. DECREASED RUMINATION TIME HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRESS, ANXIETY AND DISEASES.

OBJECTIVE ------>>>>
HERE WE ARE HAVING ACCELEROMETER DATA ALONG WITH THREE AXES, BASED ON THESE ACCELEROMETER AXES DATA, FIRST WE NEED TO CLUSTER THE DATA IN THEIR RESPECTIVE BEHAVIOR AND AFTER THAT WE NEED TO PREDICT THE RUMINATION FOR ENCOUNTERING EARLY DISEASE USING VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING MODEL.

DATA DICTIONARY --->>>>
THE DATASET IS HAVING 14595853 ROWS AND 4 COLUMNS.

TIMESTAMP: DATE AND TIME OF THE RECORDED DATA.
X-AXES: ACCELERATION DATA ALONG X-AXES. THE X-AXIS IS ORIENTED PARALLEL TO THE ANIMAL BODY (PARALLEL TO THE GROUND)

Y-AXES: ACCELERATION DATA ALONG Y-AXES. THE Y-AXIS IS ORIENTED VERTICAL TO THE ANIMAL BODY (PERPENDICULAR TO THE GROUND).

Z-AXES: ACCELERATION DATA ALONG Z-AXES. THE Z-AXIS IS ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE ANIMAL BODY (PARALLEL TO THE GROUND).

UNIT: ACCELERATION UNIT-MILLI-GRAM FORCE (MG)
